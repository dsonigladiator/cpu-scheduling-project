# cpu-scheduling-project
Contains python code for implementation of FCFS, SJF (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive) ,Round Robin CPU scheduling and Priority Scheduling algorithms

STEPS TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:

1. clone this repo / download code as zip and extract in a folder
2. Open command prompt/bash shell in that folder
3. pip install tabulate
4. Run program by executing: "python main.py" (windows) or "python3 main.py" (Mac OS / Linux)
5. You can either manually input values for any chosen algorithm or randomly generate values for the algorithm to work

Update: 26/03/2022 - Added Functionality for Priority Scheduling and fixed errors in other scheduling algorithms
